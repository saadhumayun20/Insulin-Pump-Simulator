#  Insulin Pump Simulator

A Qt-based C++ simulation of a closed-loop insulin pump system inspired by Control-IQ (like Tandem's t:slim X2), designed for educational and prototyping purposes.

---

##  Features

-  **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)** with real-time updates and trend analysis
-  **ControlIQ Algorithm** for predictive insulin dosing (basal/bolus adjustments)
-  **Manual Bolus Calculator** for user-entered glucose/carb values
-  **Profile Management** (basal rate, carb ratio, correction factor)
-  **Data Logging** of delivery events with timestamps
-  **Safety Alerts** for occlusion, low battery, low insulin
-  **Qt GUI** with live glucose charts, bolus entry, history, and profile screens
-  **Lock/Unlock PIN Screen**

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- **C++17**
- **Qt 5 (Widgets + Charts + Testlib)**
- **Qt Creator** or **command-line builds (qmake, make)**

## How to Build & Run the App
- **Option 1: Qt Creator (GUI)**
1) Open 3004_Project.pro in Qt Creator

2) Click Build then Run

- **Option 2: Terminal (CLI)**
1) cd COMP3004-Final-Project
2) qmake
3) make
4) ./3004_Project     # Launches the simulator GUI
